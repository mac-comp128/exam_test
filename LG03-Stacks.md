# Learning Goal 3: Stacks

1. Write a method called removeNegatives  that takes a stack of Integer objects as a parameter and returns the stack with all negative numbers removed. For example, if the original stack contained 30, -15, 20, -25 (top of stack), the new stack would look like 30, 20 (top of stack).

```
public Deque<Integer> removeNegatives(Deque<Integer> inStack) {

}
```

2. Which implementation of a stack (array-based or linked-node based) would be most efficient in terms of time complexity to use for the inStack parameter variable in the above question. Briefly justify your answer using big-o notation. If both implementations would be the same, state why.
