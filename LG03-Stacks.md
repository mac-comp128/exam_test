# Learning Goal 3: Stacks

Write a method called removeNegatives  that takes a stack of Integer objects as a parameter and returns the stack with all negative numbers removed. For example, if the original stack contained 30, -15, 20, -25 (top of stack), the new stack would look like 30, 20 (top of stack).

```
public Deque<Integer> removeNegatives(Deque<Integer> inStack) {

}
```
