# Learning Goal 1: Arrays

1. Write the Java code that creates and initializes an integer array named
    myIntArray with the following values: 10, 20, 30, 40.
    
```
    // Add your answer here
```

2. Write the code for the following method that returns the maximum value found in the input array.

```
public static double arrayMax(double[] data) {

}
```

3. **Optional bonus question related to sorting** Assume the input array in the previous question is an array of Strings. How would your code need to change to return the string that comes last in alphabetical ordering?
