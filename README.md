# exam_test

**This is a dummy exam.** The purpose of this repository is for you to make sure you are familiar with the process for 
accessing the questions and submitting your answers to github. 

Your Name:

Start Time:

### Instructions:



1. Clone the exam in your IntelliJ project and import the .iml file as a new module from existing sources. This will create a module named exam_test
2. Edit this README.md file to add your name at the top and the current time for when you started.
3. Work on the questions by directly editing the files to add your answers.
 Note that questions requiring code will not run, syntax highlight, or do code completion. This is by design! Our goal is that
 you understand how to code the solutions without needing Intellij as a crutch, and that you don't waste time trying to solve
 small syntax issues. We care about the big-picture learning goals more than these issues.


### Submission:

End Time:
