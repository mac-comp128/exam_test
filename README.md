# Exam Practice

**This is a dummy exam.** The purpose of this repository is for you to make sure you are familiar with the process for 
accessing the questions and submitting your answers to github. 

Your Name:


## Instructions:

1. Clone the exam to your computer and open it in VS Code.
2. Edit this README.md file to add your name at the top.
3. Work on the questions by directly editing the files to add your answers.
 
    Note that questions requiring code will not run, syntax highlight, or do code completion. This is by design! Our goal is that
 you understand how to code the solutions without needing VS Code as a crutch, and that you don't waste time trying to solve
 small syntax issues. We care about the big-picture learning goals more than these issues.

    Appropriate resources and references you may use during the exam are:  lecture notes from our class, lecture slides from our class, resources linked on our course moodle page, and code from your previous comp128 activities. You may **NOT** google for answers or look at sites like StackOverflow, you may not show/share solutions with other students in the class, and you will be asked to sign an honor statement acknowledging that you haven't. If you have questions about a problem, please ask your professor.  **Exams must be done solo.**


### Honor Code

Students are expected to maintain the highest standards of honesty in their college work; violations of academic integrity
 are serious offenses. Students found guilty of any form of academic dishonesty -- including, for instance, forgery, cheating,
  and plagiarism -- are subject to disciplinary action. By taking this exam, you accept to follow the Honor Code.
  
  For purposes of this exam, cheating is the dishonest or unauthorized use of materials for academic work. Examples of cheating include:
                             
 * Copying another’s papers or notes during an exam
 * Talking about an exam or looking at another’s exam during an exam
 * Gaining unauthorized access to past exams from a course
 * Discussing an exam you have taken with other students, either from your class or from another section of the same course, who have yet to take that exam
 * Having another person do your work for a course (including unauthorized collaboration)
 * Using unauthorized materials to help you answer the questions (See authorized materials above).

After completing the exam, you will be asked to sign an honor statement pledging your academic integrity.

## Submission:

1. Open your homework project in GitHub Desktop.
2. In the Changes tab, you will see all the source files you changed. Click on each file, and make sure that all the changes you see are changes that make sense and look good to you. This self-review process is important. Measure twice, cut once!
3. To approve the changes, check the checkbox next to each file (if it isn’t already checked). Note that your snapshot will not include any changes for files that are not checked.
4. In the box at the bottom that either says something like “Update Foo.java” or says “Summary (required),”  **Add a commit message saying:**
    
    "On this examination I have neither given nor received assistance not explicitly approved by the professor and I have seen no dishonest work by other students."

    If that statement is not true, write your own statement.    
4. Click on "Commit to Main"
5. Click on "Push to Origin" to submit. ⚠️If it’s not pushed, it’s not turned in. ⚠️
