# exam_test

**This is a dummy exam.** The purpose of this repository is for you to make sure you are familiar with the process for 
accessing the questions and submitting your answers to github. 

Instructions:
1. Clone the exam in your IntelliJ project and import the .iml file as a new module from existing sources.
2. This will create a module named exam_test
3. Work on the questions by directly editing the files to add your answers.
 Note that questions requiring code will not run, syntax highlight, or do code completion. This is by design! Our goal is that
 you understand how to code the solutions without needing Intellij as a crutch, and that you don't waste time trying to solve
 small syntax issues. We care about the big-picture learning goals more than these issues.
4. Right click on the 128-exam_test folder and then Git > Commit Directory

6. Click on Push
